# IoT-Geenhouse

Repository for group development of IoT services in the course "Vernetzung und IoT" at Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences (HKA). 

## Concept of the Course

The course not only covers the basics of networking and IoT, but is structured so that participants experience the culture of a development team and learn about their processes. 
Active learning is an important element of development work. Developing yourself and technical things means implementing a technical "idea" even if a complete knowledge base is not available.  Only an iterative approach can successfully master today's complex and interdisciplinary projects.

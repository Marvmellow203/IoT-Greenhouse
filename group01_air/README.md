# IoT-Geenhouse: Subproject Air

## Goals of the Subproject

Provide relevant data about air condition including temperature, pressure, CO2, humidity of inside and outside of the greenhouse


## List of Requirements Group01

 * Connect to mqtt broker and send example data of inside and outside air condition
 * Get actual weather data
 * Send weather data to mqtt broker
 * Get actual air data of inside via BME688 Sensor
 

## Overview Hardware System
 
 * We use a RaspberryPi 3 or 4 as computing hardware (including SD card, power supply, etc.)

 * We found a breakoutboard with a sensor which measures the value we need:
